"""
A PSR combustor. Two separate streams - one coal volatiles and the other air, both at
300 K and 1 atm flow into an adiabatic combustor where they mix and burn.

We are interested in the steady-state burning solution. Since at 300 K no
reaction will occur between methane and air, we need to use an 'igniter' to
initiate the chemistry. A simple igniter is a pulsed flow of atomic hydrogen.
After the igniter is turned off, the system approaches the steady burning
solution.
